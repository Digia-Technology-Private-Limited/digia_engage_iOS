# Production podspec — FAT binary distribution.
#
# Ships the FAT DigiaEngage.xcframework (built by Scripts/build-fat-xcframework.sh).
# Lottie, SDWebImageSwiftUI, and SDWebImageSVGCoder are statically folded into the
# framework binary — consumers do NOT need to add those pods themselves and there are
# no s.dependency lines here.
#
# Release flow:
#   1. Scripts/build-fat-xcframework.sh  →  dist/DigiaEngage.xcframework.zip
#   2. gh release create <version> dist/DigiaEngage.xcframework.zip
#   3. pod lib lint DigiaEngage.podspec --allow-warnings
#   4. pod trunk push DigiaEngage.podspec --allow-warnings
