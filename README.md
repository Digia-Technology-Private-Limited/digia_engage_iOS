Digia Engage is an iOS SDK for rendering server-driven, Digia-managed experiences inside host applications. It provides dynamic page rendering, slots, overlays, dialogs, toasts, action execution, and cached image loading for SwiftUI-based integrations.

## Requirements

| | Minimum |
|---|---|
| iOS | 16.0 |
| Swift | 5.10 |
| Xcode | 16.0 |

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Add the package to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(
        url: "https://github.com/Digia-Technology-Private-Limited/digia_engage_ios.git",
        from: "1.0.0-beta.1"
    ),
]
```

Then add `DigiaEngage` as a target dependency:

```swift
.target(
    name: "YourTarget",
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "DigiaEngage", package: "digia_engage_ios"),
    ]
)
```

Or add it directly in Xcode via **File → Add Package Dependencies** and enter the repository URL.

### CocoaPods

Add to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'DigiaEngage', '~> 1.0.0-beta.1'
```

Then run:

```bash
pod install
```

## Usage

```swift
import DigiaEngage

try await Digia.initialize(
    config: DigiaConfig(apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY")
)
```

### Render an experience

import DigiaEngage
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        DigiaHost(
          ...
        )
    }
}
```

### Render a slot

```swift
